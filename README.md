# Cat-Guardian
  #I attempted to create a bot called Cat Guardian, but due to my limited experience as a teenager, I struggled to implement the desired commands. The commands I aimed to include were ban, kick, timeout, role management, message replication by the bot, poll creation, ticketing system, to-do lists and reminders functionality, mass pinging feature, bot renaming capability, bot configuration settings, embed creation, anti-raid and anti-spam measures, invite and debug commands, message purging functionality, help command for assistance, bot information display feature, customizable bot settings, birthday tracking function, announcement broadcasting ability, keyword-based banning for users with specific terms in their usernames like “innit,” anime/TV show/book search tool integration, server backup system implementation, member count display feature, 8ball game functionality, music player integration for Discord servers, chat leveling system akin to MEE6 with level cards.

On Discord, I go by the username catssstye. The server created for Cat Guardian will also be hosted there. The project is developed using discord.js library and coded in Visual Studio Code. Please note that there are currently no implemented commands in the code. Feel free to message me for further details. and add file named commands for this listing to keep it looking good

 before using my code npm innet -y then npm install discord.js but get visual studio and node.js ok
